<h1>Monochrome Display Adapter: Notes</h1>

<p>This document describes the behaviour of IBM's original Monochrome Display
Adapter and some compatible cards.</p>

<p>The MDA is a monochrome card and displays on a TTL monochrome monitor. 
The original IBM mono monitor has green phosphor, so that's the colour I'll
use when describing its behaviour. MDA monitors also exist with amber and
white phosphor.</p>

<p>An alternative acronym for this card is MDPA (Monochrome Display and 
Printer Adapter).</p>

</ul>

<h2><a name="hwr">Hardware requirements</a></h2>
<p>The original MDA is a full-length 8-bit ISA card containing the display 
controller and a printer port. When present in a computer, it requires the 
following system resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>4k of RAM at address 0B0000h for its display buffer. This address is
not completely decoded; the entire 32k from 0B0000h to 0B7FFFh is filled
with repeats of this 4k area.</li>
<li>I/O addresses 03B0h-03BFh.</li>
<li>The printer port uses IRQ7.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="hardware">The hardware</a></h2>
<p>The MDA is based on an MC6845 cathode ray tube controller (CRTC) plus a 
lot of discrete logic. The two big chips on an MDA are the 6845 (soldered on)
and the character generator ROM (usually socketed). Since the character
set is in ROM, the only way you'll get a different one is with a new ROM.</p>

<div align="center">
	<img src="./Monochrome Display Adapter Notes_files/mdacarda.jpg" alt="" width="586" height="287">
</div>

<p>The character ROM contains not only a 14-row font for normal 
operation, but two 8x8 fonts (one with thin uprights, the other with thick
ones). This is because the same ROM is used on CGA cards; the 8x8 fonts are
not displayed by the MDA.</p>
<p>Note that the character ROM is a 9264, which has a different pinout from 
the normal 27xx chip range (2764, 27128 etc.). 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=la&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;selm=1991Feb11.154445.15362%40rodan.acs.syr.edu">This USENET posting</a>
describes how to get a 2764 ROM to work in a 9264 socket (it refers to the
5150 PC motherboard, but the pinout is the same for the MDA and CGA cards).
Because the pinout is the same, it's possible to read the character ROM from 
an MDA or CGA by plugging it into the spare ROM socket on a 5150 motherboard. 
</p>
<p>9264 pinout deduced from the above USENET post:</p>
<pre>             +---v---+
       A7  - |01   24| - Vcc
       A6  - |02   23| - A8
       A5  - |03   22| - A9
       A4  - |04   21| - A12
       A3  - |05   20| - /OE 
       A2  - |06   19| - A10
       A1  - |07   18| - A11
       A0  - |08   17| - D7
       D0  - |09   16| - D6      
       D1  - |10   15| - D5     
       D2  - |11   14| - D4    
       GND - |12   13| - D3  
             +-------+
</pre>


<p>Output is from a DE9 socket. The pinout of this socket is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Ground</li>
	<li>Ground</li>
	<li>Not connected</li>
	<li>Not connected</li>
	<li>Not connected</li>
	<li>High intensity</li>
	<li>Video</li>
	<li>Horizontal sync</li>
	<li>-Vertical sync</li>
</ol>
<p>The 'video' and 'high intensity' pins have four possible combinations:</p>
<table border="1">
<thead><tr><th>Video</th><th>High Intensity</th><th>Resulting colour</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>0</td><td>Black</td></tr>
	<tr><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>Dark green</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>Green</td></tr>
	<tr><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>Bright green</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>On some monitors 'Black' and 'Dark green' will both show as black; on 
others, they may only be distinguishable if the brightness is turned right 
up.</p>

<p>There is a single jumper (J1). In normal use, this is left open. It is
probably used for diagnostic testing; if it is closed:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The clock crystal is disabled; clock input comes from pin 4 of
	chip U24, which is not connected to anything.</li>
	<li>The character clock is stopped.</li>
	<li>The underline attribute is forced on.</li>
	<li>The VSYNC signal is (I think) disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>This appears to be used to isolate some of the card's subsystems from each
other, for testing.</p>

<h2><a name="memmap">Memory Map</a></h2>

<p>In normal use, an MDA produces an 80x25 text screen. Each character is 9
pixels wide and 14 high, giving a 720x350 pixel resolution. Although the 
characters are 9 pixels wide, the bitmaps in the ROM are only 8 pixels. For
characters C0h-DFh, the ninth pixel column is a duplicate of the eighth; for
others, it's blank.</p>

<p>The memory storage scheme is that two bytes of video RAM are used for
each character (80*25*2 = 4000, neatly fitting in the 4k RAM on the card). 
The first byte is the character code, and the second gives the attribute.</p>

<p>Character codes match whatever the font ROM in use is. Normally this is 
'codepage 437' - ASCII plus a collection of accented characters, line 
graphics and a few other characters.</p>
<div align="center">
	<img src="./Monochrome Display Adapter Notes_files/mda9.png" alt="" width="288" height="112">
</div>
<p>The attribute bytes mostly behave like a bitmap:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bits 0-2: 1 =&gt; underline, other values =&gt; no underline.</li>
<li>Bit 3: High intensity.</li>
<li>Bit 7: Blink</li>
</ul>
<p>but there are eight exceptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attributes 00h, 08h, 80h and 88h display as black space.</li>
<li>Attribute 70h displays as black on green.</li>
<li>Attribute 78h displays as dark green on green. In fact, depending on 
    timing and on the design of the monitor, it may have a bright green 
    'halo' where the dark green and bright green bits meet.</li>
<li>Attribute F0h displays as a blinking version of 70h (if blinking is 
enabled); as black on bright green otherwise.</li>
<li>Attribute F8h displays as a blinking version of 78h (if blinking is 
enabled); as dark green on bright green otherwise.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="regs">Register I/O</a></h2>

<h3>03B0h, 03B2h, 03B4h, 03B6h: CRTC address register.</h3>
<p>Write a CRTC register number (0 to 11h) to this port to select the 
CRTC register that will appear at port 03B5h. For details of the registers, 
see the 
<a href="http://www.surffi.net/~allu/shared/files/resources/crtc6545.pdf">6845
datasheet</a>.</p>
<p>These addresses are partially decoded on a real MDA, so that any even-
numbered address between 03B0h and 03B7h will get you the CRTC address register.
But the official register to use is 03B4h.</p>
<p>This is a write-only register.</p>

<h3>03B1h, 03B3h, 03B5h, 03B7h: CRTC register read/write.</h3>
<p>This gives access to the selected CRTC data register. Most CRTC registers 
are write only; some are read/write or read-only. As with the address 
register, this is partially decoded; so although the official address is
port 03B5h, it also appears at the other odd-numbered addresses between
03B0h and 03B7h.</p>

<h3>03B8h: Mode Control Register</h3>
<p>On a genuine MDA, this is a write-only register. Four of its bits can 
be set, but only two are any use:</p>
<h4>Bit 5: 1 to enable blinking, 0 to disable it.</h4>
<p>If bit 5 is 1, characters with attribute bit 7 set will blink. If not,
they will have high intensity background.</p>
<h4>Bit 3: 1 to enable video output, 0 to disable it.</h4>
<p>If bit 3 is 0, screen output will not be shown. The usual use of 
this is if you're reprogramming the CRTC registers; disable video output
beforehand and re-enable it after.</p>
<h4>Bit 1: 1 for black and white.</h4>
<p>This bit has no meaning, since the MDA always outputs in monochrome. 
The value written to it is stored (in chip U58) but nothing else on
the card pays any attention to it.</p>
<h4>Bit 0: 1 for high resolution mode.</h4>
<p>For any sane purpose this bit must be set to 1. For details of what 
happens if it is set to zero, see <a href="https://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/mda.html#hrm">High Resolution Mode</a>.</p>

<p>Quite why the MDA implements bits 0 and 1 is not clear. Possibly IBM
originally planned to make an expanded MDA that supported 40 columns and/or
colour; or perhaps the CGA was designed first, and the MDA was based on the 
CGA design, including vestiges of the CGA's 40-column and colour support. See
also <a href="https://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/mda.html#cmda">colour MDA</a>.</p>

<h3>03BAh: Status Register</h3>
<p>This is a read-only register. Only two bits of the value read from 
this port are defined:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bit 3: Video. This is 1 if a green or bright green pixel is being drawn
on the screen at this moment.</li>
<li>Bit 0: Retrace. This is 1 if the horizontal retrace is active.</li>
</ul>
<p>(On a real IBM MDA, bits 7-4 are always 1, and bits 2-1 are always 0).</p>

<h2><a name="hrm">High Resolution Mode</a></h2>

<p>According to IBM's technical manual (page 1-128), setting bit 0 of port 
03B8h to 1 puts the MDA into "high-resolution mode". One might therefore 
deduce that setting it to 0 selects a "low-resolution mode". This is not the
case.</p>

<p>Page 1-125 of the same manual warns:</p>
<blockquote>
	To ensure proper initialization, the first command issued to the 
	attachment must be to send to CRT control port 1 (hex 3B8), a hex 01,
	to set the high-resolution mode. If this bit is not set, then the 
	processor access to the monochrome adapter must never occur. If the
	high-resolution bit is not set, the processor will stop running.
</blockquote>
<p>That is, if you take an MDA out of high-resolution mode, then any attempt
to access its ports or memory could well cause the computer to hang.</p>

<p>If a zero <em>is</em> written to bit 0 of port 03B8h, the following 
MDA functions change:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The 16.257MHz pixel clock (connected to pin 6 of chip U24) is 
	not used. Instead, the pixel clock is taken from pin 5 of U24. This
	pin is connected only to a solder pad beside the clock crystal.
	This explains IBM's warning above. The pixel clock is used (among 
	other things) to pause the PC's processor if it tries to access the 
	MDA while the screen is being drawn; so if the pixel clock is stopped, 
	that might stop the processor dead as well.</li>
	<li>Characters can only be up to 8 pixels high; high resolution allows
	up to 16 pixels high (normally 14 is used).</li>
	<li>If jumper 1 is fitted, then the pixel clock is taken from pin 3 of
	U24, which on a normal MDA is connected to Ground.</li>
	<li>Jumper 1 also selects which 8x8 font is used. Rather unfortunately,
	this conflicts with all the other functions of jumper 1.</li>
</ul>

<p>From top to bottom, the four solder pads beside the clock crystal (in
the middle of this picture) are:</p>
<div> <!-- <div style="float:left"> -->
<img src="./Monochrome Display Adapter Notes_files/mdaclock.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" align="top"></div>
<ul>
	<li>Ground</li>
	<li>~ High Resolution</li>
	<li>Ground</li>
	<li>Clock input? (U24 pin 5)</li>
</ul>
<p>This suggests that the intention was to have a 4-pin header on these pads
for a second clock crystal (or other timing source) to be connected  - or,
possibly, to replace the existing crystal with one that could provide two
different clock signals. This would then have provided a suitable pixel clock 
for a low-resolution text display.</p>
<h2><a name="printer">The printer port</a></h2>
<p>The printer port on a genuine IBM MDA behaves as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Write to port 03BCh: Set data lines.</li>
	<li>Read from port 03BCh: Reads last value sent to printer. If the
	printer is trying to drive the data lines (which the manual says
	it mustn't do) then this will be ORed with the last value written.</li>
	<li>Read from port 03BDh: Get printer status.
		<ul>
			<li>Bit 3: ~Error</li>
			<li>Bit 4: Select</li>
			<li>Bit 5: Paper out</li>
			<li>Bit 6: ~Acknowledge</li>
			<li>Bit 7: Busy</li>
		</ul>
		(on a real MDA, bits 2-0 are always 1).
	</li>
	<li>Write to port 03BEh: Set control lines.
		<ul>
			<li>Bit 0: ~Strobe</li>
			<li>Bit 1: ~Auto Feed</li>
			<li>Bit 2: Initialize printer</li>
			<li>Bit 3: ~Select input</li>
			<li>Bit 4: Enable interrupt when the printer
			sets ~Acknowledge to 0.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Read from port 03BEh: Reads last value sent to port 03BEh. As 
	with port 03BCh, if the printer is driving these lines, the value will
	be ORed with the last value written. Bits 5,6,7 are undefined; on a 
	real MDA, they are always 1.</li>
</ul>	

<h2><a name="cmda">Colour MDA</a></h2>
<p>According to <cite>Programmer's Guide To PC And PS/2 Video Systems</cite>
(by Richard Wilton, ISBN 1-55615-103-9), some IBM MDA cards included support
for colour monitors:</p>

<blockquote>
	Surprisingly, a few IBM MDAs generate color as well as monochrome 
	output. Of course, the MDA's green monochrome display uses only two
	signals to control attributes (video on/off and intensity on/off); it
	ignores any color video signals. However, a color display that can
	use the MDA's 16.257 MHz horizontal sync and 50Hz vertical sync signals
	will display eight colors (with and without intensity) when attached
	to some (but not all) MDAs. Unfortunately, you can never be certain
	which MDA will turn out to be a color adapter in disguise.

<p>It is possible that these MDAs are the same thing as the early model shown 
at <a href="http://www.minuszerodegrees.net/5150/early/5150_early.htm">minuszerodegrees.net</a>, which connects the red, green and blue signals to U64. This
type of card can be recognised by the 6-way Berg connector in the top 
right-hand corner.</p>

<p>This colour functionality can be enabled on later MDAs. Comparing the 
schematics of the two versions shows which connections were removed; 
 <a href="http://www.vcfed.org/forum/showthread.php?61705-A-strange-hidden-feature-of-the-IBM-MDA-card&amp;p=496308#post496308">U30 to U63, U63 to
U64, and U64 to the 9-pin output connector.</a> Restoring the connections
with patch wires enables colour output.</p>

<h2><a name="clones">MDA Clones</a></h2>
<p>Up to this point, I've concentrated on the genuine IBM MDA. This section
gives a brief tour of how various MDA clones and supersets behave.</p>

<h3>General notes</h3>
<p>The "high resolution" bit (bit 0) of port 3B8h is nearly always ignored,
and most cards work fine with it set to zero.</p>

<p>The undefined bits of port 3BAh may not be the same combination of zeroes
and ones that they are on a real MDA; they may be all zeroes, for example.
For Hercules-compatible cards (which are a superset of MDA), bit 7 is a
vertical sync signal (1 when the screen is being drawn, 0 in the vertical 
blanking interval) and bit 1 returns lightpen status.</p>

<p>On a real MDA, the memory between B1000h and B7FFFh is filled with copies
of B0000h - B0FFFh. Some clones (particularly Hercules cards) actually have 
32k of RAM; others emulate the behaviour of a real MDA. I haven't yet seen
an MDA clone that doesn't have <em>anything</em> between B1000h and B7FFFh,
but that doesn't mean there isn't one.</p>

<p>Some MDA clones don't support dark and/or bright colours; they end up
restricted to just normal, or normal plus bright.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.seasip.info/VintagePC/5271.html">3270 PC</a></h3>
<p>The 3270 PC's video card supports programs which treat it as an MDA - either
on its own colour monitor, or on a mono monitor. The resolution is the same as 
a normal MDA (720x350) but the font used is based on the 3270 terminal rather 
than the original MDA.</p>
<p>On a mono monitor, the attributes displayed are not quite the same as on 
a real MDA:</p>
<ul>
	<li>77h and F7h display as solid green.</li>
	<li>7Fh and FFh display as solid bright green.</li>
	<li>Only 01h, 09h, 81h and 89h are underlined.</li>
	<li>78h and F8h display as black on bright green, rather than
	dark green on normal green.</li>
</ul>
<p>On a mono monitor, only one bit in the MDA mode control register has any 
effect - bit 5 (enable/disable blink). The others are ignored.</p>
<p>The video RAM repeats at 4k intervals all the way from 0B0000h to 
0BFFFFh. </p>
<p>On a colour monitor, the attributes in MDA mode act as colours
(bits 0-2=foreground, bits 4-6=background, bit 7=blink).</p>
<p>The extra video mode 30h (720x350 graphics) can be used on an MDA 
monitor. So can the 3270 emulation features.</p>

<h3>Amstrad PPC / PC20</h3>
<p>The Amstrad PPC has a chipset that can emulate MDA or CGA - either driving
a normal monitor, or its internal LCD. The desktop version 
(PC20 aka Sinclair PC200) uses a similar system, but only supports an external 
monitor.</p>
<ul>
<li>On LCDs, the screen resolution is 640x200. The 8x8 CGA font is used. 
High intensity is simulated by 'eroding' characters to make them look thin.
Underlining is not supported, and if blinking is turned off, there is no
alternative special effect.</li>
<li>On a monitor, the resolution is 640x350. The ninth column of characters is 
not drawn. In addition, the text attributes are not quite the same as on a 
real MDA. Attributes 08h and 88h display just like 18h and 98h, as bright 
green on black (on a real MDA, these would not display). Conversely, 
attributes 40h and 0C0h do not display, whereas a real MDA would display 
them in green on black.</li>
<li>There is no Hercules support. The top 4 bits of port 3BAh always 
read 0, and the display RAM does repeat at 4k intervals.</li>
<li>There is a <a href="https://www.seasip.info/AmstradXT/pc200disp.html#tech">NMI system</a> which 
catches attempts to reprogram the MDA and hands them over to the BIOS. This
is so that programs which try to change mode by manually altering CRTC 
registers still work despite the different CRTC values used by the LCD.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Hercules</h3>
<p>Most MDA clones implement some form of Hercules-compatible graphics.
The main differences for a Hercules-compatible card are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Writing to port 03BFh enables extra bits in the Mode Control
	register at 03B8h:
		<ul>
			<li>Set bit 0 of 3BFh to enable bit 1 of 3B8h</li>
			<li>Set bit 1 of 3BFh to enable bit 7 of 3B8h
			and the second 32k of RAM ("Full" mode).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Writing to port 03B8h has these extra effects (assuming the 
	appropriate bits have previously been enabled):
	<ul>
		<li>If bit 1 is set, graphics mode is selected.</li>
		<li>If bit 7 is set, the graphics frame buffer is at 0B8000h.
		Otherwise it's at 0B000h.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In "full" mode, a Herc card occupies memory between 0B0000h and
	0BFFFFh, for two frame buffers. In "half" mode, only one frame buffer
	is present, from 0B0000h to 0B7FFFh; this allows the card to be
	used in a dual-head configuration.</li>
	<li>Reading from port 03BAh returns vertical sync in bit 7, and 
	a card ID in bits 6-4:
		<ul>
			<li>000: Hercules</li>
			<li>001: Hercules Plus</li>
			<li>101: Hercules InColor</li>
			<li>111: Unknown clone (see below)</li>
		</ul>
	Only trust this ID once you've checked that there's a vertical 
	sync present; if bit 7 is the same for 32768 reads in succession,
	then there isn't.
	</li>
	<li>Some Hercules cards support a light pen. Bit 1 of port 3BAh 
	returns the lightpen sensor status; any write to port 3BBh resets
	the light pen status. </li>
</ul>
<p>One card I have encountered, which appears to be a Hercules clone of Eastern
European origin, has a further capability - two ROM fonts, selectable in 
software. These options are controlled in a similar manner to other extended 
features in the Hercules: Bit 2 of port 3BFh must be set to enable the 
feature, and then Bit 4 of port 3B8h selects which font to use. The card ID
in bits 6-4 of port 03BAh has all three bits set.</p>
